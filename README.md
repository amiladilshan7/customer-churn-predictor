# üîÆ **Customer Churn Predictor**

Hey there! This is a complete, end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a company). It's not just a notebook; it's a fully functional web application built with Flask.

The whole idea is to help a business identify at-risk customers so they can offer incentives and prevent them from leaving, which ultimately saves money and keeps customers happy.

---

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

* **Real-Time Predictions:** A simple web interface where you can input customer details and get an instant churn probability.
* **Machine Learning Model:** Uses a Logistic Regression model trained on real-world data to make its predictions.
* **Full Stack:** Built with a Python backend (Flask) and a simple HTML/CSS frontend.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack & Concepts**
This project showcases a range of skills and technologies, including:

* **Language:** Python
* **Backend:** Flask (a lightweight web framework)
* **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn for modeling, Pandas for data manipulation, and Joblib for saving our trained model.
* **Frontend:** Simple HTML and CSS.

## **Core ML Concepts:**

* Supervised Learning & Classification
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
* Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)

## üìä **The Dataset**
This project uses the popular **Telco Customer Churn** dataset. It's a synthetic dataset from IBM that mimics real customer data, including demographics, services signed up for, account information, and which customers left within the last month.

You can find and download the dataset on **Kaggle**.
